    "# Introduction to Regression Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression analysis, it is crucial not only to estimate the parameters of a model but also to evaluate how well the model fits the data. This process is known as regression diagnostics. \n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore key diagnostics that help us check:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The normality of residuals\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals)\n",
    "- Linearity\n",
    "- Independence of errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these diagnostics is vital for validating the assumptions of linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Regression Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple linear regression model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( y \\) is the dependent variable\n",
    "- \\( x \\) is the independent variable\n",
    "- \\( \\beta_0 \\) and \\( \\beta_1 \\) are the model parameters\n",
    "- \\( \\epsilon \\) is the error term (residual)\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions of linear regression include that residuals \\( \\epsilon \\) should be normally distributed, have constant variance, and be independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through key regression diagnostics to check these assumptions.\n",

    "# Exploring Linear Regression with `statsmodels`\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is one of the most commonly used techniques in data analysis. It helps in modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The simplest form of linear regression is when there is only one independent variable (simple linear regression). When there are multiple independent variables, we call it **multiple linear regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Linear Regression?\n",
    "Linear regression allows us to:\n",
    "1. Understand relationships between variables.\n",
    "2. Make predictions for future data.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the importance of different variables.\n",
    "4. Check the assumptions of the model (via diagnostics).\n",

    "- **`statsmodels.formula.api`**: Allows fitting models using R-style formulas.\n",
    "- **`statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS`**: Fits ordinary least squares (OLS) models.\n",
    "- **`statsmodels.api.add_constant()`**: Adds an intercept to your model.\n",
